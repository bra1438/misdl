# Traffic_Sign_Classifier-with-Streamlit

## Project overview
- The aim of this project is to focus on the first fundamental features of the decision making ability of an autonomous vehicle, 
i.e., to develop a deep learning model that reads traffic signs and classifies them correctly using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).

- The traffic sign classifier uses a German traffic dataset. The German traffic dataset consists of
34,799 32*32 pixels colored images that is used for the training dataset, 12,630 images are used
for the testing dataset and 4410 images are used in the validation dataset where each images is a
photo of a traffic sign belonging to one of the 43 classes i.e., traffic sign types.
